    "output": "You want to know what's the best part about being a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist in a suit of armor?  Well, let me tell you, it's the tech, baby. I mean, I've created something truly revolutionary here. The suit's capabilities are unparalleled, and I'm not just talking about the repulsor technology or the flight capabilities. I'm talking about the AI, JARVIS. He's the real brains behind the operation, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a bit of a narcissist.\n\nBut seriously, being Iron Man is about more than just the tech. It's about the impact I can have on the world. I've saved countless lives, stopped villains from wreaking havoc, and inspired a whole new generation of inventors and engineers. And let's not forget the suit itself – it's a work of art, a masterpiece of engineering and design. I mean, who wouldn't want to wear a suit of armor that's essentially a flying, shooting, and hacking machine?\n\nOf course, there are also the perks. I mean, who wouldn't want to be a superhero? The fame, the adoration, the respect... it's all pretty great. But at the end of the day, it's not just about me. It's about using my talents and resources to make a difference in the world. And if that means wearing a fancy suit of armor, then so be it.",

The Chelsea shot-stopper looks certain to leave Stamford Bridge at the end of the season after losing the No 1 spot to Thibaut Courtois. Cech will hold talks with manager Jose Mourinho at the end of the season where the keeper will confirm his decision to leave west London. Arsenal must make a swift decision on Petr Cech this summer or risk losing out on the goalkeeper. The Chelsea stopper looks certain to leave Stamford Bridge at the end of the season after losing his No 1 spot. Arsene Wenger must be swift with a move for his top goalkeeping target to beat the competition to him. The Gunners are long-term admirers of Cech and are considering a move for the keeper ahead of next season. However, Arsenal will not be the only club interested in luring Cech when the transfer window reopens. Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain, Roma and Inter Milan are all showing an interest in the 32-year-old and Cech is understood to be keen on resolving his future as quickly as possible this summer. That means the Gunners could miss out on their primary goalkeeping target if they don't make an early move. However, there are some major obstacles Arsenal must overcome before landing Cech. The first is the goalkeeper's valuation. Despite the fact Cech enters the final year of his contract this summer, Chelsea will demand in excess of £10million for the custodian. Thibaut Courtois has become Chelsea's first choice goalkeeper after three years on loan at Atletico Madrid. Chelsea's stance over their players joining rivals weakened with the sale of Juan Mata to Manchester United. The Blues believe Cech can play for at least another eight seasons and that his next club will be signing a world class goalkeeper in his prime. His price will reflect that view. Likewise, the Gunners may find that Chelsea are reluctant to sell them Cech. In recent years, the Blues have shown a hesitancy in selling players to their Premier League rivals, though that stance weakened last season with Juan Mata's exit to Manchester United. Cech and Courtois have spent a season sharing the gloves at Chelsea, but the veteran will now move on. Signing Cech would significantly strengthen the Gunners next season, and Chelsea could yet refuse to sell the keeper to their London rivals. Cech would consider moving to the Emirates Stadium, despite spending over 10 years with Chelsea, and hopes his long period of service will allow him to make the final decision on his next destination."

I have no answer to that because I had no control or power to change what came up on the screen.\" Gods and Generals (film) Gods and Generals is a 2003 American period war drama film written and directed by Ronald F. Maxwell. It is an adaptation of the 1996 novel of the same name by Jeffrey Shaara and prequel to Maxwell's 1993 film \"Gettysburg\". The film stars Stephen Lang as Stonewall Jackson, Jeff Daniels as Lieutenant Colonel\nand worked without pay. Among them, 2nd South Carolina String Band portrays the players of \"The Bonnie Blue Flag\" during a troops entertainment music show. In exchange, Ted Turner agreed to donate $500,000 to Civil War battlefield preservation. The movie was filmed in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, western Maryland and in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. Actual historic locations in the film include Virginia Military Institute and Washington & Lee University, known as Washington College during the Civil War. Russell Crowe was the original choice to play Stonewall Jackson, but scheduling conflicts prevented his availability in the summer and fall\nof 2001 when the movie was filmed. Stephen Lang had begun to reprise his role as George Pickett, but instead was asked to fill in the role of Jackson. Billy Campbell, who had played a 44th New York lieutenant in \"Gettysburg\" was called in to hastily replace Lang in the role of Pickett. Although Tom Berenger desired to reprise his \"Gettysburg\" role as James Longstreet (which he called his favorite role) he was unavailable because of scheduling difficulties. Bruce Boxleitner was instead cast in the role. Darius N. Couch was portrayed by actor Carsten Norgaard. Martin Sheen was prevented from\nthe role of Colonel Nathan Jessup in \"A Few Good Men,\" a role made famous on film (1992) by Jack Nicholson. He is the winner of over half a dozen theatre awards including the Drama Desk and Helen Hayes awards. In films, he played Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett in \"Gettysburg\" (1993) and the lead role of Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson in the Gettysburg prequel \"Gods and Generals\" (2003), both from director Ronald F. Maxwell. He considers \"Gods and Generals\" to be his finest performance. Arguably, his most famous film role, before \"Avatar\", was his portrayal of the villainous Ike Clanton\nWho played stonewall jackson in gods and generals?"
